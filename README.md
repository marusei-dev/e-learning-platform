# e-learning-platform
This platform connects teachers and learners through online courses. Teachers can build courses with lessons, submit them for approval, and share knowledge. Learners browse courses, track their progress, and mark lessons as completed.

Administrators ensure quality by reviewing submissions. Everyone gets a tailored experience: teachers manage content, learners focus on their goals, and admins maintain standards.

It’s designed to make learning organized, accessible, and engaging—whether you’re sharing expertise or gaining new skills.
